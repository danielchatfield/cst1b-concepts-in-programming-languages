    \question Compare the motivations and innovations of LISP and Algol. You
      may wish to read chapters 3 and 5 of \emph{Concepts in Programming
      Languages} by Mitchell.

    \question For your favourite programming language, discuss the following
      points:

      \begin{parts}
        \part What was the motivation for the language?

        \part Does the language have a simple and unambiguous execution model?

        \part Is the langage design grounded in theory?

      \end{parts}

    \question Discuss what factors you consider important for successful
      language design. Justify your answer.

    \question Discuss and evaluate the typing disciplines of assembly (one of
      x86, ARM, MIPS, etc.), Javascript, C, ML, Haskell, Agda, and another
      language of your choice. Compare the advantages and disadvantages that
      their design impose on the programmer.

    \question Based on your programming experience, identify a motivation for
      the design of a new programming language. Describe how you would design this language. Justify your decisions.

    \question Compare the STG machine with the abstract machine used for LISP.
